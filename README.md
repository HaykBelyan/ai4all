# AI4ALL Armenia Website

This repository contains the source code for the official AI4ALL Armenia website, a modern, responsive, and fully internationalized web application built with React. The project was developed based on a detailed blueprint with a mission to democratize AI education in Armenia.

### âœ¨ Core Features

*   **Fully Responsive Design:** A mobile-first approach ensures a seamless experience on all devices, from phones to desktops.
*   **Complete Internationalization (i18n):** Full support for Armenian (`hy`) and English (`en`), with Armenian set as the default language. Users can switch languages instantly with a flag-based switcher.
*   **Dynamic On-Scroll Animations:** Content gracefully fades and slides into view as the user scrolls, powered by the performant Intersection Observer API.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** Built with React, promoting reusable, manageable, and scalable code.
*   **Client-Side Routing:** Utilizes `react-router-dom` for instant page navigation without full reloads, including dynamic routes for course detail pages.
*   **Simulated AI Features:** Includes a mock "AI Helper" chatbot to demonstrate the potential for AI-enhanced user experiences.
*   **Modern Development Environment:** Built with Vite for a fast and efficient development workflow.
*   **Professional Styling:** Styled with SASS/SCSS for organized, nested, and variable-driven stylesheets.

The project follows a logical and scalable folder structure:
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/ # Static assets (images, videos, flags)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ assets/ # Global assets like SCSS files and images
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ components/ # Reusable React components (Header, Footer, Cards)
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ common/ # Components used across multiple pages
â”‚ â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ home/ # Components specific to the HomePage
â”‚ â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ data/ # Mock data files (courses, success stories)
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/ # Custom React hooks (useIntersectionObserver)

### ðŸŒŸ Future Enhancements

This project serves as a robust foundation. Future improvements could include:

*   **Headless CMS Integration:** Replace the local `data` files with API calls to a headless CMS like [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) or [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) to allow non-developers to manage content.
*   **Functional AI Chatbot:** Integrate a real NLP service like [Google Dialogflow](https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow) to make the FAQ chatbot fully functional.
*   **Backend for Registration:** Develop a backend service to handle user registration for courses and partner inquiries.
*   **Testing:** Implement a testing strategy with libraries like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) to ensure code quality and reliability.
